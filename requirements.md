# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Marketing Ecosystem is a self-evolutionary, human-in-the-loop platform that automates the complete lifecycle of digital marketing content. The system operates as an active operator rather than a passive tool - it validates brand assets, generates platform-specific content, manages deployment, monitors engagement, and automatically closes the feedback loop through continuous optimization. The platform maintains persistent brand memory and evolves its marketing effectiveness over time through sentiment analysis and performance-driven adjustments.
